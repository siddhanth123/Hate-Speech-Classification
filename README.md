# Hate-Speech-Classification

This project implements a hate speech classification system using natural language processing and deep learning techniques. It encompasses the full machine learning pipeline, from data preparation and model training to deployment as a REST API. The system utilizes pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings and a bidirectional GRU neural network to classify text as either hate speech or non-hate speech. The project includes comprehensive documentation, evaluation metrics, and a FastAPI interface for easy integration and testing, making it suitable for both educational purposes and potential real-world applications in content moderation.
